Criterion A: Initial investigation
----------------------------------

**Summary of problem**

Client runs an Amul retail shop. The daily records are maintained in a book. It
is necessary to keep a record of the daily sales for proper stock maintenance.
It is very problematic for the workers to write down all the sales by themselves
in a notebook while they also have to pay attention to the customers who are in
a hurry. Thus, the workers have to choose the option of entering the data once
all the customers are gone, which often leads to them forgetting to write the
record. This also creates problems in the accounts.

For stock maintenance, a person has to count or estimate the number of each
product that is remaining at the end. A number is estimated for each product
that has to be purchased. The ordering number for each product changes according
to the days of the week and the festivals. This takes up a lot of time. Also,
since the number of products remaining is counted by the worker manually, there
are often mistakes. Also, new products are constantly being introduced and the
rates of the existing ones keep on changing so there should be an option for
adding a new product and editing the existing one.

The customer records need to be saved on a place where all the records are
available at once. This is because my client finds it difficult to store and
retrieve all the information.

So an IT system should eliminate most of these problems.
