Criterion B: Analysis
---------------------

### Proposed solution: 

When I was discussing the issue with my client, we came across the following
possible solutions:

1.  Making an excel sheet in which all the data can be typed and entered

2.  Using Google forms to make a form by which the daily sales can be entered
    into a spreadsheet.

3.  Making form in web pages and connecting in with database software for data
    feeding and extraction

4.  Using a pre-created software for inventory management

After the discussion of the pros and cons of each of these suggestions, we
agreed upon executing the 3rd solution.

-   Choosing an option from a drop down list to process and display information
    about the products

### Security

-   Avoiding unauthorized access in the database files.

-   Avoiding unauthorized access for destructive manipulation of data

### Specific performance criteria

1.  Provide a user friendly and easily navigable system

2.  Provide an efficient system for quick functionality

3.  Create a website that has the same design for all forms

4.  To develop a secure method to deny access for the database file to
    unauthorized people.

**Justification of chosen solution**

Â  We believe that the proposed solution is the most efficient in this case. This
is because an easy to use, quick, accurate and specialized system was needed.

The system needs to be used by people who are computer illiterates. So the user
interface should be as objective as possible. This is the reason why forms are
being used. Choosing of a product has been made elementary by adding a drop in
the form. Mobile number of the customer was used to search for the customer
records, which making retrieving the data faster. The interface is made
minimalistic to make it easily accessible and quicker.

The data entered will also be accurate since very less needs to be typed.
